    <h2>Influencer Selection</h2>
    <p>
      Klap is an AI platform designed to help creators monetize YouTube Shorts. Many creators previously needed professionals to shorten their long-form podcasts or videos, which could take hours, especially when adjusting dimensions to keep the focus on speakers. Klap efficiently solves this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn't target AI influencers directly to achieve optimal results, despite them being the most obvious choice. Instead, we focused on influencers who help creators improve their content—social media coaches, business coaches, UGC coaches, and those who teach businesses and content creators how to maximize their time effectively.

    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      The content strategy for this campaign was straightforward yet highly effective. Our goal was to achieve the results of paid ads—low CPM and high reach—while leveraging influencers' trust with their audiences. We adopted a hybrid approach to accomplish this, combining UGC, Spark Ads, and various creative techniques to ensure that even paid content felt completely organic within users' feeds. This seamless integration helped maximize engagement and drive conversions without disrupting the user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach enabled us to reach nearly <strong>11 million people</strong> in just 13 months solely through influencer collaborations—without factoring in paid ads. The results spoke for themselves, as the platform saw an impressive growth of approximately <strong>450,000 new users</strong>, as reflected on their website.
