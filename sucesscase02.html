     <h2>Influencer Selection</h2>
     
      <p>
        Airial is an AI platform designed to assist travelers in planning their trips. Previously, many creators relied on professionals to create itineraries and book hotels, flights, and tickets. Airial streamlines this process, making travel planning more efficient.    
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than targeting AI influencers, who may seem like the obvious choice, we focused on influencers who specialize in travel planning, sharing itineraries, and providing tips to make traveling easier. This approach allowed us to achieve optimal results.

      <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The content strategy for this campaign was simple yet highly effective. Our goal was to achieve the results of paid ads—low CPM and high reach—while leveraging influencers' trust with their audiences.  

      </p>
      <p>
        We adopted a hybrid approach to achieve this, collaborating with top-performing micro- and mid-tier influencers. Instead of prioritizing follower count, we emphasized engagement and past growth to ensure maximum impact. This strategy provided the best value for our investment and helped establish Airial as a recognized name in travel planning.
