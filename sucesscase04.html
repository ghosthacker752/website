     <h2>Influencer Selection</h2>
     
      <p>
        SofaTutor is one of the most renowned online learning platforms, with over 1.6 million active users. To run a cost-effective campaign, SofaTutor partnered with hundreds of end-user influencers rather than big names.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As their go-to for influencer research, we helped them identify and vet the best micro-influencers—a strategic move that significantly contributed to their success. By manually researching top-performing micro-influencers, we connected them with Instagram and YouTube accounts run by parents, positioning them strongly in a highly competitive market.  
      </p>
       <p>Focusing on the German audience, we helped SofaTutor find thousands of influencers based in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.</p>
