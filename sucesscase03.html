     <h2>Influencer Selection</h2>
     
      <p>
        Beans is a remittance company that helps travelers exchange their local currencies into most major currencies worldwide. Targeting travelers and those who assist them was the obvious choice for their campaign.  

      </p>
      <p>
        We helped Beans identify and vet top influencers in Spanish-speaking countries, negotiate highly competitive rates, and onboard key Hero Influencers for their campaigns. This strategy led to significant growth, resulting in hundreds of thousands of app downloads and even attracting offers from influencers eager to collaborate further.

      <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The content strategy for this campaign was simple yet highly effective. Our goal was to achieve the best results on a budget—low CPM and high reach—while leveraging influencers' trust with their audiences.  

      </p>
      <p>
        We crafted a detailed content brief, provided influencers with content ideas, and developed a customized strategy tailored to what works best on each influencer’s page. This approach led to multiple viral videos, driving significant growth for Beans.
